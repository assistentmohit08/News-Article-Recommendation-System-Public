This project is a Hybrid News Recommendation System designed to provide personalized financial news article recommendations by combining Content-Based Filtering and Collaborative Filtering techniques. The system leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning to analyze user behavior and article content, delivering relevant and meaningful news suggestions.

The application is implemented as a full-stack web application, where the backend is built using Flask and Machine Learning models, and the frontend is developed using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to ensure a clean and user-friendly interface.
